            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p><b>Description:</b> 
                I was created a <b>Basic calculator</b> using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, With the standard mode Calculator(Basic) 
                to implement interactive interface with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
                operations. The calculator have an display screen to show user input and results. i was used a 
                CSS grid system for button alignments. I was used if-else statements, operators, and
                loops to handle user input and perform calculations. This project requires some skill but can be
                done with basic knowledge of these technologies.

            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p></p><b>Description:</b>
                In my final year mechanical engineering I was done a project on <b>Dual axis power generating by using
                solar tracking system and wind power energy.</b> We have prepared a supporting frame to the both solar 
                panel and modified wind turbine. At the top we have placed a solar panel with Light Detective Resistor
                (LDR) which is used to detect the sunlight and moves along the direction which is diploying on the LDR's.
                the wind turbine will be used at higher hill areas to make the turbine rotation because the hill area are 
                getting wind 1.3 meter/sec. the overall project is for showing voltage on the displayed screen which is 
                connected to both solar panel rotating motor and dynamometer of the modified wind turbine.
